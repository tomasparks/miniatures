# Summary

Celebrating the 25th anniversary of Myst! From the company that created Myst, the Myst Marker Switch based on the 3D model from the original game.

# Print Settings

Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.15mm
Infill: 15

Notes: 
Model in image printed at 0.15mm at 82%. No supports needed. Larger size or higher resolution may allow enough clearance for switch to function, but the handle is delicate.

Note: Because these STL files are modified versions of the actual original Myst models, and because we are new to 3D printing - there are some issues. Thanks for the community help... we'll happily update our files with better versions. And just FYI - our printed versions were all sliced with Cura 3.3.1.
