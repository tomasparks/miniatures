# Summary

Celebrating the 25th anniversary of Myst! From the company that created Myst, the Myst Rocket based on the 3D model from the original game.


# Print Settings

Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.15mm
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
Model in image printed at 0.15mm at 100%. The rear section may require a raft for better adhesion. (This version requires the halves to be glued together.)

Note: Because these STL files are modified versions of the actual original Myst models, and because we are new to 3D printing - there are some issues. Thanks for the community help... we'll happily update our files with better versions. And just FYI - our printed versions were all sliced with Cura 3.3.1.
